# MPI-Tutorials-ESM-School-2016

I taught this course at the Advanced School on Earth System Modelling, IITM Pune (India) in 2016
The contents of this repository have been inspired from the coursera course on High Performance Scientific Computing by Dr Randall Leveque
The course material is present at http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/uwhpsc-coursera/

Another important link I would recommend is mpitutorial.com
It has a list of very useful books

http://mpitutorial.com/recommended-books/
which can be handy in learning mpi from scratch
