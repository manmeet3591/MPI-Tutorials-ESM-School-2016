How to compile and run FMS shallow-water code; P. S. Swathi 8/1/10
The script to use is 
shallow_water_zhi_nansen/shallow_water/scripts/run_shallow_water_model_tsunami_altix_linear

For my shorthand notation I will use expdir =  shallow_water_zhi_nansen/shallow_water/

Before you use this do the following:

1. Go to $expdir/bin see if you have a mkmf template which corresponds to your system.
If not create one using mkmf.template.ia64 as a sample. Make sure you put the right
includes (-I) to have netcdf include files. The linker (LDFLAGS) should point to
netcdf and mpi libraries. If you are running on a single processor, you will not
need the mpi library. 

The mkmf template  you create will have a final extension of platform_name 
which you will use as follows in the runscript.

set platform = platform_name 


2. If you are running on a single processor,

set npes = 1

3. Make sure you have a big stacksize set. Run the script and the results will go to $workdir.


Good luck
