Instructions to set up FMS-Heat Equation code
Edit run_heat_eqn_swm_debug
Change the following

1. OUTPUT_PATH  directory where you will put the code
2. MPPNCCOMBINE ..This is the mppnccombine you have built for combining nc files
3. WORKDIR -- mkdir this
4. FMS_UTILS - This is where you have the shared code of FMS from the shallow water case
5. MKMF - mkmf perl script.
6. template -- Instead of using mkmf.template, we just give it here. Copy stuff from your
   mkmf.template.xxx file and stcik it here.

Good luck.
