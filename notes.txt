The contents of this repository have been inspired from the coursera course on High Performance Scientific Computing by Dr Randall Leveque 
The course material is present at http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/uwhpsc-coursera/

Another important link I would recommend is mpitutorial.com
It has a list of very useful books 

http://mpitutorial.com/recommended-books/
which can be handy in learning mpi from scratch
